Polymorphism & Composition Homework - Quiz

Polymorphism

1 - What does the word 'polymorphism' mean?
Polymorphism is ability to treat an object as more than one type, eg. A person can be a partner, parent, child, sibling, cousin, employee, a supporter, a volunteer etc.

We can use abstract classes and interface classes


4 - How many 'forms' can an object take when using polymorphism?
It can take many forms


5 - Give an example of when you could use polymorphism.
Polymorphism may be used to reduce DRY code, by replacing separate instances of similar classes with a super class that can call on the elements of the similar classes within.

6 - What do we mean by 'composition' in reference to object-oriented programming?


7 - When would you use composition? Provide a simple example in Java.
